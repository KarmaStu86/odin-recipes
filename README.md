This will be a very simple website to demonstrate the basic HTML I have learnt during the Odin Project so far.

The website has now had an index page created which links to various recipe pages. At this point recipes have been added for two different meals: lasagna and fajitas.

Added an additional recipe for Stir Fry and linked this to the index page.

Added a CSS style sheet which changes the colour and background colour of the a, h1 and h2 elements on all pages.
